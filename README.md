Project: Library Application

Current Version: 1.0

Overview: App that allows the user to keep track of books they have read or are in the progress of reading.

App is based off of this odin project lesson: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library


Version History:

1.1:
  App now checks user input form for blank fields before accepting a new book.

1.0: 
  Project will currently allow the user to add and remove books from the library. However, the app does NOT yet have persistance. As soon as the page is refreshed all of the data will be reset.
  
  Learning to store data will be my next task. I plan to save the data locally first before eventually branching out to an online database (ie. Firebase).
